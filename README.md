# Website Image Optimisation Script
---------------

## How do I install and run this?
Firstly, you'll need to clone down this directory, which you can do by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luke-coleman/tinyPNGBulk
```
You'll need to have Node.JS installed on your machine, which you can download from [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure you have this installed, otherwise nothing will work. 

Then you'll need to navigate to where ever you've cloned this file to, then you'll need to download the relevant packages, this can be done with the following:

```bash
cd /Documents/Git/tinyPNGBulk
npm i
```

After NPM has finished installing, you can then run:
```bash
node index.js
```
